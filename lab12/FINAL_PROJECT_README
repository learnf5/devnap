The final project requires configuration from previous labs.

Create custom response, configure curl to be allowed as a legal request and not be written to the security log as an un-trusted bot, 
add data guard with a custom pattern with 9 digits for example like the Canadian ID#, 
and add all customizations to a custom policy that starts with the NginxStrictPolicy.json file.

policy_customResponse.json file goes in /home/student/Desktop/Lab_Files directory
policy_curl.json goes in /home/student/Desktop/Lab_Files directory
CustomStrict.json goes in /home/student/Desktop/Lab_Files directory
